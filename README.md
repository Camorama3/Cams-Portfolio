# Cams-Portfolio

## Description

This webpage will serve as a portfolio for not only describing who i am but also showcasing my abilities to code using CSS and HTML. This exercise helped me to understand how to nest CSS elements, format a webpage, use links and make a webpage overall visually appealing. I will continue to grow this webpage the more I code, and I will continue to add to it as time passes and I gather more knowledge to feature.
